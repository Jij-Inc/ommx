OMMX Artifact Design
=====================

OMMX Artifact is a specification for packaging and distributing OMMX Messages and associated metadata over the OCI Artifact defined in [OCI Image specification 1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md) and [OCI Distribution specification 1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md).

Metadata and Reference
-----------------------

The problem that metadata should solve is the reference between data.

- Even if the schema of the data is defined, the moment it is saved to a file or DB and separated from the application, the relationship between the data is lost.
  - For example, within the solver process, it is clear which Instance the Solution is for, but after saving to a file or DB, it is no longer apparent.

- Wouldn't it be better to always save the Solution and Instance together in a file?
  - This simply increases the amount of data to be saved. Considering cases where many Solutions are generated by changing parameters for a single Instance, saving all Instances is inefficient. Moreover, as the amount of data increases, the overhead of exchanging that data also becomes significant.

- Therefore, a reference mechanism is introduced.
  - Reference refers to sufficient information to obtain the data even without the actual data.
  - If the data is not shared between machines, the path in the file system can serve as a reference, but if it is shared over the Internet, a URI is needed. Introducing a reference function is closely tied to how to retain and obtain the data.

Specification
--------------

OMMX Artifact is an OCI Artifact of media type `application/org.ommx.v1.artifact`.
OCI Artifact is represented as an [OCI Image manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/manifest.md).
OMMX Artifact is a collection of `config`, `layers`, and annotations.

- `config` is a JSON blob with the following media types:
  - `application/org.ommx.v1.config+json`
- `layers` consists of the following blobs:
  - `application/org.ommx.v1.solution` blob with the following annotations:
    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.instance`: (digest) The corresponding instance of the solution
    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.solver`: (JSON) The solver information which generated the solution as a JSON
    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.parameters`: (JSON) Solver parameters used to generate the solution as a JSON
    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.start`: (RFC3339) The start time of the solution as a RFC3339 string
    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.end`: (RFC3339) The end time of the solution as a RFC3339 string
  - `application/org.ommx.v1.instance` blob with the following annotations:
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.title`: (String) The title of this instance
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.created`: (RFC3339) When this instance was created
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.authors`: (String) Name of authors. Multiple authors are separated by comma (`,`)
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.license`: ([SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/)) License of this instance
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.dataset`: (String) Name of the dataset this instance belongs to
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.variables`: (Integer) Number of variables in this instance
    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.constraints`: (Integer) Number of constraints in this instance
  - `application/vnd.numpy`: NumPy's ndarray with NPY format
  - `application/vnd.apache.parquet`: DataFrame with Parquet format
  - And other blobs with appropriate media types. The media type SHOULD be registered in the [IANA media type registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).
    - Users can add arbitrary annotation to arbitrary layer. `org.ommx.user.` prefix is reserved for user-defined annotations.
- Annotations in manifest:
  - TBA

Note that other annotations listed above are also allowed.
The key may not start with `org.ommx.v1.`, but must be a valid reverse domain name as specified by OCI specification.

Storage Formats
---------------

OMMX Local Registry supports two storage formats for artifacts:

### OCI Directory Format (oci-dir)

The traditional format where artifacts are stored as directory structures following the OCI Image Layout specification. Each artifact is stored as a directory containing:
- `oci-layout` file indicating OCI compliance
- `blobs/` directory containing content-addressable blobs
- `index.json` file with manifest references

This format is suitable for:
- Local development and testing
- File system-based storage
- Cases where individual blobs need direct access

### OCI Archive Format (oci-archive)

A single-file format where the entire artifact is packaged as a tar archive with `.ommx` extension. This format contains the same OCI structure but packaged for easier distribution.

This format is suitable for:
- Cloud object storage systems (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
- Artifact distribution and sharing
- Backup and archiving scenarios
- Network transfer optimization

### Format Selection and Compatibility

- **New artifacts default to oci-archive format** for better cloud storage compatibility
- **Both formats are fully supported** for loading and manipulation
- **Backward compatibility is maintained** - existing oci-dir artifacts continue to work
- **Format detection is automatic** - the system transparently handles both formats
- **Cross-format operations are supported** - you can load from one format and save to another

### Migration Between Formats

Artifacts can be converted between formats using the standard API:

```python
# Load from either format
artifact = Artifact.load("image-name:tag")

# Convert oci-dir to oci-archive
dir_artifact = ArtifactDir.from_oci_dir("/path/to/oci-dir")
archive_artifact = dir_artifact.save("/path/to/output.ommx")

# The system automatically detects and uses the appropriate format
```
