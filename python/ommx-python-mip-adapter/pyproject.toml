# FIXME 
# ======
# To support Python 3.12 and Apple silicon systems, this requires latest version of Python-MIP (will be 1.16.0?),
# which does not release yet. https://github.com/coin-or/python-mip/issues/384
# This project uses dev-dependency to use the latest version of Python-MIP not to include pre-release version in the release.
