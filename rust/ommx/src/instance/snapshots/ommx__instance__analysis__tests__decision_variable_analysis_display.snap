DecisionVariableAnalysis {
  Total Variables: 5

  Kind-based Partitioning:
    Binary: 5, Integer: 0, Continuous: 0, Semi-Integer: 0, Semi-Continuous: 0

  Usage-based Partitioning:
    Used: 3 (in objective: 2, in constraints: 2 constraints), Fixed: 1, Dependent: 1, Irrelevant: 1

  Binary Variables (5):
    x0: [0, 1]
    x1: [0, 1]
    x2: [0, 1]
    x3: [0, 1]
    x4: [0, 1]

  Used in Objective (2):
    x1, x2

  Used in Constraints (2 constraints):
    0: x1, x2
    1: x0

  Fixed Variables (1):
    x0 = 1

  Dependent Variables (1):
    x3 (Binary, [0, 1]): x0 + x1

  Irrelevant Variables (1):
    x4 (Binary, [0, 1]): will be set to 0
