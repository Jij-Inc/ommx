# Rust Idiomatic Solution and SampleSet Implementation

## Overview

This PR completes the Rust SDK v2 architecture by implementing strongly-typed `Solution` and `SampleSet` alternatives to Protocol Buffer auto-generated types, following the same design principles established for constraints and decision variables.

## Completed Implementation ✅

### Core Types
- **`Solution`**: Single solution result with data integrity guarantees
  - Private fields with `getset` getters for controlled access
  - BTreeMap collections for O(log n) ID-based lookups
  - On-demand feasibility computation with parse-time validation
  - Flattened structure with optimality and relaxation as direct fields

- **`SampleSet`**: Multiple sample solution results with deduplication
  - Required objectives field (not Optional) for consistent API
  - Efficient sample ID validation across all components
  - Feasibility maps cached internally with validation during parsing
  - Complete Parse trait implementation with consistency checks

### Decision Variable Types
- **`EvaluatedDecisionVariable`**: Single evaluation result with data integrity
- **`SampledDecisionVariable`**: Multiple sample results with deduplication
- **`DecisionVariableMetadata`**: Auxiliary metadata separation
- Complete `Evaluate` trait implementation for `DecisionVariable`

### Key Improvements
- **Parse Trait Integration**: Complete `parse_as` usage throughout codebase
  - Context-aware error messages for better debugging
  - Modular parsing with `Parse for v1::SampledDecisionVariable`
  - Consistency validation with `EvaluatedDecisionVariable::new`

- **Sampled Data Structure Optimizations**:
  - ✅ Removed `get_mut` method to prevent unintended shared mutations
  - ✅ Optimized `new_dedup` with HashMap for O(1) lookups (was O(n²))
  - ✅ Fixed `has_same_ids` to correctly handle unordered HashMap keys

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Added cargo insta commands to Taskfile.yml
  - Comprehensive snapshot testing for error messages
  - Full round-trip testing for all new types

### API Design
- **Data Integrity**: Private fields prevent external modification
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with controlled access patterns
- **Performance**: BTreeMap for efficient lookups, HashMap for deduplication
- **Memory Efficiency**: Sampled<T> enables deduplication of shared values

## Breaking Changes
- `Sampled<T>::get_mut` removed (use immutable access only)
- `Sampled<T>::new_dedup` now requires `T: Hash + Eq + Clone` (was `T: PartialEq`)

## Benefits Achieved
- **Complete Type System**: All core types now use strongly-typed Rust implementations
- **Improved Performance**: O(1) deduplication, efficient ID-based lookups
- **Enhanced Safety**: No unintended mutations in deduplicated data
- **Better Error Messages**: Context-aware parsing with detailed error traces
- **Full Test Coverage**: 204 Rust tests passing

## Migration Notes
For code using `Sampled<T>::get_mut`, replace with:
- Creating new `Sampled` instances with modified data
- Using immutable access patterns with `get()`

## Testing
- All 204 Rust tests passing
- Python bindings automatically benefit from these improvements
- Comprehensive round-trip testing ensures Protocol Buffer compatibility

## Next Steps
With this PR merged, the Rust SDK v2 architecture is complete and ready for production use with:
- Complete feature parity with v1
- Improved type safety and performance
- Full backward compatibility via Protocol Buffer conversion layer
