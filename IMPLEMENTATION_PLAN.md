# OMMX Rust SDK v2 Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Rust SDK v2 implementation is now complete with all planned features implemented and tested.

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Core Types (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] `Sampled<T>` with deduplication support
- [x] `ConstraintID`, `VariableID`, `SampleID` type-safe wrappers
- [x] `ConstraintMetadata`, `DecisionVariableMetadata` for auxiliary data
- [x] `EvaluatedConstraint`, `SampledConstraint` with data integrity
- [x] `EvaluatedDecisionVariable`, `SampledDecisionVariable` with data integrity

### Phase 2: Solution Types (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] `Solution` with BTreeMap collections and on-demand feasibility
- [x] `SampleSet` with efficient sample validation
- [x] Parse trait implementations for all v1 types
- [x] Complete round-trip conversion support

### Phase 3: Integration (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] Instance evaluation methods using new types
- [x] Python bindings with automatic type conversion
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (204 tests)
- [x] Documentation updates

### Phase 4: Optimization (COMPLETE ✅)
- [x] HashMap-based O(1) deduplication in `Sampled::new_dedup`
- [x] Removed `get_mut` for safer API
- [x] Fixed `has_same_ids` for correct behavior
- [x] Parse-time validation for early error detection

## Key Design Achievements

1. **Type Safety**: All core types use strongly-typed Rust implementations
2. **Data Integrity**: Private fields with controlled access via getters
3. **Performance**: O(log n) BTreeMap lookups, O(1) HashMap deduplication
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Deduplication support throughout
5. **Error Handling**: Context-aware parsing with detailed error traces
6. **API Consistency**: Clean separation of essential vs auxiliary data

## Production Readiness

The implementation is ready for production use with:
- Complete feature parity with v1 Protocol Buffer types
- Full backward compatibility via conversion layer
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimizations in place
- Safe API design preventing common mistakes

## Future Considerations

While the core implementation is complete, potential future enhancements could include:
- Copy-on-Write for `Sampled<T>` mutations (if needed)
- Additional performance optimizations based on usage patterns
- Extended Python API leveraging the Rust performance benefits
- Additional solver adapter integrations

## Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v1:
1. Replace direct Protocol Buffer usage with Rust SDK types
2. Use `parse()` method for Protocol Buffer → Rust conversion
3. Use `into()` method for Rust → Protocol Buffer conversion
4. Replace `Sampled::get_mut` with immutable patterns
5. Update trait bounds for `new_dedup` users

The Rust SDK v2 provides a solid foundation for OMMX's future development with improved type safety, performance, and maintainability.
