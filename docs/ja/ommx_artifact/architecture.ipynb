    "OMMX Artifact Design\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "OMMX Artifact is a specification for packaging and distributing OMMX Messages and associated metadata over the OCI Artifact defined in [OCI Image specification 1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md) and [OCI Distribution specification 1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/v1.1.0/spec.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata and Reference\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that metadata should solve is the reference between data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even if the schema of the data is defined, the moment it is saved to a file or DB and separated from the application, the relationship between the data is lost.\n",
    "  - For example, within the solver process, it is clear which Instance the Solution is for, but after saving to a file or DB, it is no longer apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wouldn't it be better to always save the Solution and Instance together in a file?\n",
    "  - This simply increases the amount of data to be saved. Considering cases where many Solutions are generated by changing parameters for a single Instance, saving all Instances is inefficient. Moreover, as the amount of data increases, the overhead of exchanging that data also becomes significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, a reference mechanism is introduced.\n",
    "  - Reference refers to sufficient information to obtain the data even without the actual data.\n",
    "  - If the data is not shared between machines, the path in the file system can serve as a reference, but if it is shared over the Internet, a URI is needed. Introducing a reference function is closely tied to how to retain and obtain the data.\n",

    "OMMX Artifact is an OCI Artifact of media type `application/org.ommx.v1.artifact`.\n",
    "OCI Artifact is represented as an [OCI Image manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/manifest.md).\n",
    "OMMX Artifact is a collection of `config`, `layers`, and annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `config` is a JSON blob with the following media types:\n",
    "  - `application/org.ommx.v1.config+json`\n",
    "- `layers` consists of the following blobs:\n",
    "  - `application/org.ommx.v1.solution` blob with the following annotations:\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.instance`: (digest) The corresponding instance of the solution\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.solver`: (JSON) The solver information which generated the solution as a JSON\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.parameters`: (JSON) Solver parameters used to generate the solution as a JSON\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.start`: (RFC3339) The start time of the solution as a RFC3339 string\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.solution.end`: (RFC3339) The end time of the solution as a RFC3339 string\n",
    "  - `application/org.ommx.v1.instance` blob with the following annotations:\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.title`: (String) The title of this instance\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.created`: (RFC3339) When this instance was created\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.authors`: (String) Name of authors. Multiple authors are separated by comma (`,`)\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.license`: ([SPDX License Identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/)) License of this instance\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.dataset`: (String) Name of the dataset this instance belongs to\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.variables`: (Integer) Number of variables in this instance\n",
    "    - `org.ommx.v1.instance.constraints`: (Integer) Number of constraints in this instance\n",
    "  - `application/vnd.numpy`: NumPy's ndarray with NPY format\n",
    "  - `application/vnd.apache.parquet`: DataFrame with Parquet format\n",
    "  - And other blobs with appropriate media types. The media type SHOULD be registered in the [IANA media type registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).\n",
    "    - Users can add arbitrary annotation to arbitrary layer. `org.ommx.user.` prefix is reserved for user-defined annotations.\n",
    "- Annotations in manifest:\n",
    "  - TBA\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that other annotations listed above are also allowed.\n",
    "The key may not start with `org.ommx.v1.`, but must be a valid reverse domain name as specified by OCI specification."
