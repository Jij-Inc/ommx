    "We have to discuss the following points to answer the question.\n",

    "- Where OMMX is used?\n",
    "- Why schema is required?\n",
    "- Text-based or Binary-based?\n",

    "### Where OMMX is used?\n",
    "Mathematical programming has been a subject of study in academic fields for a considerable period of time, and numerous software tools have been developed to improve problem-solving capability. However, these tools are basically designed for use in a research process. When we attempt to use these invaluable tools in a real-world business process, we refer to it as \"OROps\" (OR = operations research); like \"MLOps\" in the machine-learning field, we have to face many problems. The most significant problem is the lack of interoperability between tools. We have to convert data between tools, and it is a time-consuming and error-prone process. OMMX is designed to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why schema is required?\n",
    "Unlike the research process, where few researchers use and create few tools, in OROps, many developers use and create many tools. The interoperability between tools becomes a significant issue due to this point. It is possible for humans to manage input and output data stored in general-purpose data formats like JSON or HDF5 for a few tools, but it is hard for many tools. Thus, we have to introduce machine-readable schema.\n",

    "\n",
    "- OMMX defines a protocol buffers schema with version like `v1`, `v2`, etc. `v1` schema has a namesapce `ommx.v1`.\n",
    "- Schemas in `ommx.v1` will be compatible after [ommx.v1 schema release](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/ommx/milestone/3). Note that the schema can be changed incompatible way until this release.\n",
    "- `v2` schema with namespace `ommx.v2` will start developing if we need to change the schema in incompatible way after `ommx.v1` release. Compatible changes will be made in `v1` schema also after its release. We never create namespaces like `ommx.v1_1`."
