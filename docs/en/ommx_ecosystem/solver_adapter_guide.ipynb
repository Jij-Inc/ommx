    "# OMMX Solver Adapter Implementation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Currently, an implementation guide for the Adapter (OMMX Sampler Adapter) to execute Sampler from OMMX is also being prepared.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the recommendations for implementing an Adapter (hereafter called OMMX Solver Adapter) to execute Solver from OMMX. By following the guidelines below when implementing the OMMX Solver Adapter, you can maintain a certain level of consistency with other OMMX Solver Adapters, providing a better user experience for users utilizing multiple OMMX Solver Adapters. Therefore, the OMMX community recommends adhering to the following content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is recommended that the adapter `OMMXxxxAdapter` for using Solver from OMMX inherits and implements the abstract base class `SolverAdapter`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from ommx.ommx_adapter import SolverAdapter\n",
    "\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    ``` \n",
    "- The constructor of `OMMXxxxAdapter` should accept `ommx.v1.Instance` and perform the following processes:\n",
    "    - Generate the Solver’s input format (data and objects) from the `ommx.v1.Instance`.\n",
    "    - Generate any data necessary for `OMMXxxxAdapter.decode`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, ommx_instance: ommx.v1.Instance):\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- The `OMMXxxxAdapter.solve` method should be provided as a static method for easily using Solver from OMMX.\n",
    "    - It is not necessary to implement all Solver parameters as arguments. Such use cases can be sufficiently achieved by directly using the `OMMXxxxAdapter` class.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        @staticmethod\n",
    "        def solve(ommx_instance: ommx.v1.Instance) -> ommx.v1.Solution:\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- The `OMMXxxxAdapter.solver_input` property should be provided as a property to obtain Solver's input format (data and objects) from OMMX.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        @property\n",
    "        def solver_input(self) -> SolverInput:\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- The `OMMXxxxAdapter.decode` method should be provided as a method to convert Solver's output format (data and objects) to `ommx.v1.Solution`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        def decode(self, solver_output: SolverOutput) -> ommx.v1.Solution:\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- When defining arguments other than those in the methods implemented in `SolverAdapter`, use keyword-only arguments with default values\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        def __init__(self, ommx_instance: ommx.v1.Instance, *, kwarg=\"default\", ...):\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some items that, while not strongly recommended, may still be worth considering for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OMMXxxxAdapter.decode_to_state` method: A method to convert Solver's output format (data and objects) to `ommx.v1.State`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from ommx.ommx_adapter import SolverAdapter\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class OMMXxxxAdapter(SolverAdapter):\n",
    "    \t...\n",
    "    \tdef decode_to_state(self, data: SolverOutput) -> ommx.v1.State:\n",
    "    \t\t...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `yyy_to_instance` function: A function to convert Solver's input format to `ommx.v1.Instance`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def xxx_to_instance(data: Any) -> ommmx.v1.Instance:\n",
    "    \t\t...\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "## User Experience Guaranteed by OMMX Solver Adapters that Meet the Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "OMMX Solver Adapters that meet the above recommendations can provide the following consistent user experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For users who want to use Solver in a straightforward way—without worrying about its input/output or parameters—it's easy to run Solver using the common static method `solve`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from ommx_xxx_adapter import OMMXxxxAdapter\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ommx_solution = OMMXxxxAdapter.solve(ommx_instance)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Users who want to tune Solver can execute it by setting Solver parameters directly using the `OMMXxxxAdapter` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from ommx_xxx_adapter import OMMXxxxAdapter\n",
    "\n",
    "    adapter = OMMXxxxAdapter(ommx_instance)\n",
    "    solver_input = adapter.solver_input\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ... # Tune Solver here and execute to obtain solver_output\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ommx_solution = adapter.decode(solver_output)\n",
