    "# Implementing an OMMX Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in [Solve with multiple adapters and compare the results](../tutorial/switching_adapters), OMMX Adapters have a common API. This common API is realized by inheriting the abstract base classes provided by the OMMX Python SDK. OMMX provides two abstract base classes depending on the type of adapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`ommx.adapter.SolverAdapter`](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/python/ommx/autoapi/ommx/adapter/index.html#ommx.adapter.SolverAdapter): An abstract base class for optimization solvers that return one solution\n",
    "- [`ommx.adapter.SamplerAdapter`](https://jij-inc.github.io/ommx/python/ommx/autoapi/ommx/adapter/index.html#ommx.adapter.SamplerAdapter): An abstract base class for sampling-based optimization solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Solvers that produce multiple solutions can be automatically treated as solvers returning a single solution by selecting the best sample. Therefore, `SamplerAdapter` inherits `SolverAdapter`. If you are unsure which one to implement, consider the number of solutions: if the solver returns one solution, use `SolverAdapter`; if it returns multiple solutions, use `SamplerAdapter`. For example, exact solvers like [PySCIPOpt](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt) should use `SolverAdapter`, while samplers like [OpenJij](https://github.com/OpenJij/OpenJij) should use `SamplerAdapter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OMMX, a class inheriting `ommx.adapter.SolverAdapter` is called a **Solver Adapter** and one inheriting `ommx.adapter.SamplerAdapter` is called a **Sampler Adapter**.\n",
    "For clear explanation in this chapter, the software that the adapter wraps (such as PySCIPOpt or OpenJij) is referred to as \"backend solver\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adapter Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The adapter process can be roughly divided into these 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert `ommx.v1.Instance` into a format the backend solver can understand\n",
    "2. Run the backend solver to obtain a solution\n",
    "3. Convert the backend solver's output into `ommx.v1.Solution` or `ommx.v1.SampleSet`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because step 2 is nothing but the usage of the backend solver, we assume you are familiar with it. This tutorial explains steps 1 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many backend solvers are designed to receive only the minimum necessary information to represent an optimization problem in a form suitable for their algorithms, whereas `ommx.v1.Instance` contains more information, assuming optimization as part of data analysis. Therefore, step 1 involves discarding much of this information. Additionally, OMMX manages decision variables and constraints with IDs that are not necessarily sequential, while some backend solvers manage them by names or sequential numbers. This correspondence is needed in step 3, so the adapter must manage it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, in step 3, `ommx.v1.Solution` or `ommx.v1.SampleSet` cannot be constructed solely from the backend solver's output. Instead, the adapter will construct `ommx.v1.State` or `ommx.v1.Samples` from the backend solver's output and the information from step 1, then convert it to `ommx.v1.Solution` or `ommx.v1.SampleSet` using `ommx.v1.Instance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing a Solver Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will implement a Solver Adapter using PySCIPOpt as an example. For a complete example, refer to [ommx-pyscipopt-adapter](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/ommx/tree/main/python/ommx-pyscipopt-adapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will proceed in the following order to make it easier to execute step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement functions to construct a PySCIPOpt model from `ommx.v1.Instance` one by one.\n",
    "- Finally, combine these functions into the `OMMXPySCIPOptAdapter` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Exception\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is good to define custom exceptions. This makes it easier for users to understand which part is causing the problem when an exception occurs."

    "### Setting Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "PySCIPOpt manages decision variables by name, so register the OMMX decision variable IDs as strings. This allows you to reconstruct `ommx.v1.State` from PySCIPOpt decision variables in the `decode_to_state` function mentioned later. Note that the appropriate method depends on the backend solver's implementation. The important thing is to retain the information needed to convert to `ommx.v1.State` after obtaining the solution."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learned how to implement an OMMX Adapter by connecting to PySCIPOpt as a Solver Adapter and OpenJij as a Sampler Adapter. Here are the key points when implementing an OMMX Adapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement an OMMX Adapter by inheriting the abstract base class `SolverAdapter` or `SamplerAdapter`.\n",
    "2. The main steps of the implementation are as follows:\n",
    "   - Convert `ommx.v1.Instance` into a format that the backend solver can understand.\n",
    "   - Run the backend solver to obtain a solution.\n",
    "   - Convert the backend solver's output into `ommx.v1.Solution` or `ommx.v1.SampleSet`.\n",
    "3. Understand the characteristics and limitations of each backend solver and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "4. Pay attention to managing IDs and mapping variables to bridge the backend solver and OMMX.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to connect your own backend solver to OMMX, refer to this tutorial for implementation. By implementing an OMMX Adapter following this tutorial, you can use optimization with various backend solvers through a common API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed implementation examples, refer to the repositories such as [ommx-pyscipopt-adapter](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/ommx/tree/main/python/ommx-pyscipopt-adapter) and [ommx-openjij-adapter](https://github.com/Jij-Inc/ommx/tree/main/python/ommx-openjij-adapter)."
